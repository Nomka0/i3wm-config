# Custom riced i3wm-config
It's the first time I make this kind of repository, so I don't know if it's well structured.
But anyway, here's the config I made to make my i3 look like this (perhaps I ommited some things, I'll update this later lol)


### Screenshots

custom neofetch with berserk's sacrifice mark

For status bar, Awesome font was used, it includes a lot of icons that were used as labels for the icons (the os came like that, I just tweaked it a little bit). I modified the i3-blocks and i3 config files so it looked like that. bandwidth2 file was modified as well so the status bar shows KB instead of MB.

I'll be leaving the ascci art I made for the sacrifice mark for neofetchtoo

## Dependencies
I based my config on the one from this guy https://github.com/laintnaya/i3wm-rice-BlueLain/, tho I'll be leaving the ones I have as well:
* [feh] (wallpapers) for the slideshow I made a little script with a while sleep function within it
* [cava] (sound bars)
* [cmus] (console music player)
* [htop] (console interactive process viewer)
* [spotiflyer] (to download music lol)
