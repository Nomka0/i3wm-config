# Custom riced i3wm-config
It's the first time I make this kind of repository, so I don't know if it's well structured.
But anyway, here's the config I made to make my i3 look like this (perhaps I ommited some things, I'll update this later lol)

custom neofetch with berserk's sacrifice mark

##Dependencies
I based my config in the one from this guy https://github.com/laintnaya/i3wm-rice-BlueLain/, tho I'll be leaving the ones I have as well:
* [feh] (wallpapers) for the slideshow I made a little script with a while sleep function within it
* [cava] (sound bars)
* [cmus] (console music player)
* [htop] (console interactive process viewer)
* [spotiflyer] (to download music lol)

I'll be leaving the ascci art I made for the sacrifice mark for neofetchtoo
